# ðŸ’³ Financial Fraud Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Intoduction
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect and analyse fraudulent financial transactions. Traditional fraud detection methods rely on static rule-based systems, which can be bypassed as fraud tactics evolve. By utilising supervised and unsupervised learning, this project aims to develop dynamic models that can effectively adapt and identify fraudulent behaviour based on historical data.

The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation heatmaps, feature engineering, and the development of classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. It leverages data from real or simulated transaction histories and includes an optional pipeline to extract data from a database.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

* Datasets - Contains raw and processed transaction data.
* Corr Plot - Correlation heatmap (Corr plot.png) to visualise feature relationships.
* Yahs
** Jadwani

### CODE Files

* webscraping.ipynb - file used for web scraping
* Batter and Bowler - folders containing files used for batters and bowlers, respectively
* Top10ICC_allRounder_analysis.ipynb - file used for the analysis of ICC TOP 10 All-Time All-Rounders
* Failed chapters - folders containing files for self-organizing maps and neural network analysis
* classification_%_% - files containing clustering and classification for both bowlers and batters
* EDA_batters.ipynb and EDA_Bowlers.ipynb - files containing exploratory data analysis and KPI extraction for batters and bowlers, respectively.

## Conclusion
The main conclusion of this project is that rating individuals in team sports, especially T20 cricket, is a complex and challenging task. While traditional performance indicators such as batting and bowling averages reveal a great deal about a player's performance, they are not sufficient for the shortest format of the game with a less number of balls. Instead, machine learning techniques can be used to develop new performance indicators based on a player's roles, KPIs, and other features. This project provides several insights and findings on how to apply machine learning techniques to rate T20 cricket players.

## Dependencies
This project uses several Python packages and libraries, including:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* beautifulsoup4
